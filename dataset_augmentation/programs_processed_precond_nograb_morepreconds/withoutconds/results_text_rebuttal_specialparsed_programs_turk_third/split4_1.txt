vacuum carpet
I bring my vacuum cleaner into the living room.  I plug it into the wall.  I press the on switch on the vacuum cleaner.  I push the vacuum cleaner back and forth over the length and width of the carpet until I have vacuumed the entire carpet.  I turn the vacuum cleaner off.  I take the vacuum cleaner back to the hall closet.
