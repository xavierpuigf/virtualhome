Wash dishes with dishwasher
I walk to the kitchen. I open the dishwasher. I open the kitchen cabinet. I reach inside the cabinet and grab the box of dish soap. I add some soap to the open dishwasher. I put the box of dish soap back in the kitchen cabinet. I close the kitchen cabinet and then I close the dishwasher. I turn the dishwasher on and wait.
