Wash teeth
Upon entering the restroom, walk to the sink. Take a toothbrush and apply enough toothpaste so that 1/4 of the brush is covered (this is the appropriate amount). Proceed to "brush" your teeth using an up and down motion with the brush in your mouth. Brush for 2 minutes covering all areas of the teeth. Rinse with water and clean toothbrush with water too.
