Clean toilet
Use the toilet bowl cleaner and squeeze it around the inside of toilet bowl. Let it sit in there while you clean the rest of the toilet. Spray the all purpose cleaner on top of toilet, sides, bottom, and on and under the seat and lid. Wipe down toilet with paper towels on all the areas you sprayed the cleaner. Now using the toilet brush, scrub the inside bowl around completely in all areas.
